# CLI-Gen

CLI-Gen is an innovative open-source project that aims to use graph-based code representation and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test case generation and client library creation.

## Project Vision

CLI-Gen explores how a graph data structure can act as a central element for understanding various code elements and the relations between them. This understanding forms the foundation for intelligent automation in software development tasks.

## Planned Key Features

- Graph-based code and API analysis
- Intelligent test case generation for API and non-API projects
- Context-aware client library generation from OpenAPI specs
- LLM integration for advanced code understanding

## Current Status

CLI-Gen is currently in the conceptual and planning phase. We're actively working on the core architecture and will be implementing features in the near future.
