# CLI-Gen

CLI-Gen is an innovative open-source project that aims to use graph-based code representation and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test case generation and client library creation.

## Project Vision

CLI-Gen explores how a graph data structure can act as a central element for understanding various code elements and the relations between them. This understanding forms the foundation for intelligent automation in software development tasks.

## Current Status

CLI-Gen is currently in the conceptual and planning phase. We're actively working on the core architecture and will be implementing features in the near future.

Here are some of the features that I have completed implementing:
- **[AST Generator CLI](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/cli-gen/tree/main/jsCodeExplorer)**: AST Generator is a command-line tool that generates Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for JavaScript files in a specified directory. It processes all JavaScript files recursively in the given directory and provides a sample output of the generated ASTs.
- **[Knowledge Graph Generator](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/cli-gen/tree/main/astGraphCreator)**: This project is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser and knowledge graph generator for JavaScript code. It takes JavaScript ASTs in JSON format and converts them into a queryable knowledge graph structure.  

## Planned Key Features

- Graph-based code and API analysis
- Intelligent test case generation for API and non-API projects
- Context-aware client library generation from OpenAPI specs
- LLM integration for advanced code understanding
