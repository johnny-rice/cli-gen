## Code of Conduct

While we don't have a formal code of conduct yet, we expect all contributors to behave professionally and respectfully. Harassment, hate speech, and discriminatory behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.

## Future Code Contributions

As the project evolves and we begin implementation:

- We'll update this guide with information on our chosen programming language(s) and development practices.
- We'll provide guidelines for code style, testing, and submission processes.
- We'll create a roadmap to help guide development efforts.

Stay tuned for updates as we move from concept to implementation!

## Questions?

If you have any questions about contributing, please don't hesitate to ask in our [Discussions](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/cli-gen/discussions) area.
